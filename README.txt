This Project is opensource, so feel free to contribute in this project.

There are a couple few stapes to run this program in your machine. The first one is to write the whole code by yourself, which is effective for learning but insane work for production. The second one is to copy this repo.

If you're writing all by yourself, make sure your directory looks like this:
.
|
|_books
|   |_pdfFile
|
|_main.py


If you're copying this, follow the following steps:

1) Copy this repo using this command 'git clone https://github.com/Akash-nath29/audioBook.git'
2) redirect to the directory using 'audioBook'
3) Install required packags using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
4) Run the Python file 'python main.py'

Enjoy !!
